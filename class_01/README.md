# NLP: A Primer

## üîñ Outline

* NLP in the Real World
    * Core applications:

         * Email platforms, such as Gmail, Outlook, etc., use NLP extensively to provide a range of product features, such as spam classification, priority inbox, calendar event extraction, auto-complete, etc.

         * Voice-based assistants, such as Apple Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana, and Amazon Alexa rely on a range of NLP techniques to interact with the user, understand user commands, and respond accordingly.

         * Modern search engines, such as Google and Bing, which are the cornerstone of today‚Äôs internet, use NLP heavily for various subtasks, such as query understanding, query expansion, question answering, information retrieval, and ranking and grouping of the results, to name a few.

         * Machine translation services, such as Google Translate, Bing Microsoft Translator, and Amazon Translate are increasingly used in today‚Äôs world to solve a wide range of scenarios and business use cases. These services are direct applications of NLP.
     
    * Other applications:

         * Organizations across verticals analyze their social media feeds to build a better and deeper understanding of the voice of their customers. We‚Äôll cover this in Chapter 8.

         * NLP is widely used to solve diverse sets of use cases on e-commerce platforms like Amazon. These vary from extracting relevant information from product descriptions to understanding user reviews. Chapter 9 covers these in detail.

         * Advances in NLP are being applied to solve use cases in domains such as healthcare, finance, and law. Chapter 10 addresses these.

         * Companies such as Arria [1] are working to use NLP techniques to automatically generate reports for various domains, from weather forecasting to financial services.

         * NLP forms the backbone of spelling- and grammar-correction tools, such as Grammarly and spell check in Microsoft Word and Google Docs.

         * Jeopardy! is a popular quiz show on TV. In the show, contestants are presented with clues in the form of answers, and the contestants must phrase their responses in the form of questions. IBM built the Watson AI to compete with the show‚Äôs top players. Watson won the first prize with a million dollars, more than the world champions. Watson AI was built using NLP techniques and is one of the examples of NLP bots winning a world competition.

         * NLP is used in a range of learning and assessment tools and technologies, such as automated scoring in exams like the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), plagiarism detection (e.g., Turnitin), intelligent tutoring systems, and language learning apps like Duolingo.

         * NLP is used to build large knowledge bases, such as the Google Knowledge Graph, which are u
