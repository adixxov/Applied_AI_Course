# NLP: A Primer

## üîñ NLP in the Real World

### Core applications:

         * Email platforms, such as Gmail, Outlook, etc., use NLP extensively to provide a range of product features, such as spam classification, priority inbox, calendar event extraction, auto-complete, etc.

         * Voice-based assistants, such as Apple Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana, and Amazon Alexa rely on a range of NLP techniques to interact with the user, understand user commands, and respond accordingly.

         * Modern search engines, such as Google and Bing, which are the cornerstone of today‚Äôs internet, use NLP heavily for various subtasks, such as query understanding, query expansion, question answering, information retrieval, and ranking and grouping of the results, to name a few.

         * Machine translation services, such as Google Translate, Bing Microsoft Translator, and Amazon Translate are increasingly used in today‚Äôs world to solve a wide range of scenarios and business use cases. These services are direct applications of NLP.
     
### Other applications:

         * Organizations across verticals analyze their social media feeds to build a better and deeper understanding of the voice of their customers.

         * NLP is widely used to solve diverse sets of use cases on e-commerce platforms like Amazon. These vary from extracting relevant information from product descriptions to understanding user reviews. Chapter 9 covers these in detail.

         * Advances in NLP are being applied to solve use cases in domains such as healthcare, finance, and law. Chapter 10 addresses these.

         * Companies such as Arria [1] are working to use NLP techniques to automatically generate reports for various domains, from weather forecasting to financial services.

         * NLP forms the backbone of spelling- and grammar-correction tools, such as Grammarly and spell check in Microsoft Word and Google Docs.

         * Jeopardy! is a popular quiz show on TV. In the show, contestants are presented with clues in the form of answers, and the contestants must phrase their responses in the form of questions. IBM built the Watson AI to compete with the show‚Äôs top players. Watson won the first prize with a million dollars, more than the world champions. Watson AI was built using NLP techniques and is one of the examples of NLP bots winning a world competition.

         * NLP is used in a range of learning and assessment tools and technologies, such as automated scoring in exams like the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), plagiarism detection (e.g., Turnitin), intelligent tutoring systems, and language learning apps like Duolingo.

         * NLP is used to build large knowledge bases, such as the Google Knowledge Graph, which are useful in a range of applications like search and question answering.
           

### NLP Tasks:

         * Language modeling: This is the task of predicting what the next word in a sentence will be based on the history of previous words. The goal of this task is to learn the probability of a sequence of words appearing in a given language. Language modeling is useful for building solutions for a wide variety of problems, such as speech recognition, optical character recognition, handwriting recognition, machine translation, and spelling correction.

         * Text classification: This is the task of bucketing the text into a known set of categories based on its content. Text classification is by far the most popular task in NLP and is used in a variety of tools, from email spam identification to sentiment analysis.
  
         * Information extraction: As the name indicates, this is the task of extracting relevant information from text, such as calendar events from emails or the names of people mentioned in a social media post.
  
         * Information retrieval: This is the task of finding documents relevant to a user query from a large collection. Applications like Google Search are well-known use cases of information retrieval.
  
         * Conversational agent: This is the task of building dialogue systems that can converse in human languages. Alexa, Siri, etc., are some common applications of this task.
  
         * Text summarization: This task aims to create short summaries of longer documents while retaining the core content and preserving the overall meaning of the text.
         * Question answering: This is the task of building a system that can automatically answer questions posed in natural language.
  
         * Machine translation: This is the task of converting a piece of text from one language to another. Tools like Google Translate are common applications of this task.
  
         * Topic modeling: This is the task of uncovering the topical structure of a large collection of documents. Topic modeling is a common text-mining tool and is used in a wide range of domains, from literature to bioinformatics.

### Machine Learning for NLP

Machine learning techniques are applied to textual data just as they‚Äôre used on other forms of data, such as images, speech, and structured data. Supervised machine learning techniques such as classification and regression methods are heavily used for various NLP tasks. As an example, 

         * an NLP classification task would be to classify news articles into a set of news topics like sports or politics.
         
         * regression techniques, which give a numeric prediction, can be used to estimate the price of a stock based on processing the social media discussion about that stock. 
         * unsupervised clustering algorithms can be used to club together text documents.

        #### 1. Naive Bayes
        Naive Bayes is a classic algorithm for classification tasks [16] that mainly relies on Bayes‚Äô theorem (as is evident from the name). Using Bayes‚Äô theorem, it          calculates the probability of observing a class label given the set of features for the input data.
